Building the university campus is not an easy job for a small team. If you're interested, let us know!!

## Things that I can help with
Whether you are a builder, landscaper or love to interior design, some of the things we may need help on are:
* Building the building itself
* Furnishing the building
* Building the area surrounding the building
* Layouts
* and more...

## Do you have a deadline?
We understand building the campus may be time-consuming and you may have other things to deal with at the moment. Not to worry. Just come on and build whenever you're free.
